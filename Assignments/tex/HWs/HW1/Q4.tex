\noindent \textbf{4. We want to check if there is an element occurs more than $n/2$ times in an array containing $n$ elements, assuming only equality checks are allowed.}

\noindent (a) Algo.\ref{alg:find} is part of the required algorithm. What is the time complexity now? \\
\textblue{It is $O(n)$ now.}
\newline

\noindent (b) Make the algorithm complete by adding a few more lines to substitute the underlined text. Your modification should NOT change the time complexity. Be sure to return things as indicated.
