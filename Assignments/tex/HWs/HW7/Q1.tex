\noindent \textred{1.} 
True or False: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] BST operations (search, predecessor, successor, minimum, insert, delete) are $O(h)$, where $h$ is height of the tree. \hfill \textblue{True}
    \item[(b)] The height of a binary search tree with $n$ elements is $\Theta(\log(n))$. \hfill \textblue{False}
    \item[(c)] In-order tree walk of a binary search tree outputs an unsorted sequence. \hfill \textblue{False}
    \item[(d)] When deleting node $z$ with 2 children, we cannot replace $z$ by its predecessor. \hfill \textblue{False}
    \item[(e)] In an AVL tree, the right subtree and the left subtree of any node have the same height. \hfill \textblue{False}
    \item[(f)] Worst-case tree height for AVL tree with n nodes is $\Theta(\log(n))$. \hfill \textblue{True} \\
