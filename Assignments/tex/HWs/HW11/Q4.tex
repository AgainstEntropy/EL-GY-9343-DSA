Let $G$ be an $n$-vertex connected undirected graph with costs on the edges, and the number of edges is $m = O(n^2)$. Assume that all the edge costs are distinct.

\begin{itemize}
    \item[(a)] Prove that $G$ has a unique MST; \\
    \myAnswer{
    Because all the edge costs are distinct, there is an unique sorting of all edges, according to which we can run Kruskalâ€™s algorithm in the graph. Therefore, there will generate a uniquely determined MST.
    }
    \item[(b)] Give an algorithm to find a cycle in $G$ such that the maximum cost of edges in the cycle is minimum among all possible cycles. The time complexity of your algorithm should be $O(m \log n)$. Assume that the graph has at least one cycle, and finding MST takes $O(m \log n)$ time. 
    \myAnswer{
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item First, find the MST. During the finding we also have been  tracking the edge of minimum cost.
        \item Then, among all edges that are not in MST, find the edge of minimum cost, which becomes the edge asked to find.
    \end{enumerate}
    The second step takes at most $O(m)$ time, Thus the total time complexity is $O(m \log n) + O(m) \sim O(m \log n)$.
    }
\end{itemize}
