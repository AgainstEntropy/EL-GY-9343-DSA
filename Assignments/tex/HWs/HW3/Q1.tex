\noindent \textred{1.} True or False questions: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] One can find the maximum sub-array of an array with $n$ elements within $O(n \log n)$ time. 
    \text{~} \hfill \textblue{True} 
    \item[(b)] In the maximum sub-array problem, combining solutions to the sub-problems is more complex than dividing the problem into sub-problems. 
    \hfill \textblue{False}
    \item[(c)] Bubble sort is stable. 
    \hfill \textblue{True} 
    \item[(d)] When input size is very large, a divide-and-conquer algorithm is always faster than an iterative algorithm that solves the same problem. 
    \hfill \textblue{False}
    \item[(e)] It takes $O(n)$ time to check if an array of length n is sorted or not. 
    \hfill \textblue{True} 
    \item[(f)] Insertion sort is NOT in-place. 
    \hfill \textblue{False}
    \item[(g)] The running time of merge-sort in worst-case is $O(n \log n)$. 
    \hfill \textblue{True} \\
\end{enumerate}
