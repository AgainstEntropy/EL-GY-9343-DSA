# EL-GY-9343-DSA

This repo is for the course of NYU EL-GY 9343 Data Structure and Algorithm, taught by Professor Yong Liu in 2023 Fall.

## Content

Besides [course slides](./Slides/), [past exam papers](./Exams/), and [assignments with solutions](./Assignments/), I also provide [all tex files](./Assignments/tex/) of mine when doing homework. Self-made cheatsheets for midterm and final exam are also attached.

## Softwares

I used [Excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw) to create cheatsheets and some of figures in my assignments.
